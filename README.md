# LowFER

Code for the paper "LowFER: Low-rank Bilinear Pooling for Link Prediction", ICML 2020

### Experiments

See `experiments.txt` for the commands to run the model with the best hyperparameters.

### Requirements

The original codebase was implemented in Python 3.6.6. Required packages are:
```
numpy      1.15.1
pytorch    1.0.1
```
### Scripts

Run the scripts from main directory as `python -m scripts.filename`:

`toy_example.py`: This script contains the toy dataset used to visualize Proposition 1 in the paper. It runs LowFER under the conditions specified and shows that it perfectly separates positive examples from negative examples.

`bilinear_models_relations.py`: This script runs the conditions presented in relation to bilinear models (section 4.3) with a toy setup and shows the equivalence between the LowFER version of other bilinear models and the true scoring functions of those models.

`relation_results_analysis.py`: Evaluates per relation metrics on WN18/RR dataset using LowFER as reported in the per relation analysis results (section 5.4). It requires a trained model, so please first run LowFER for WN18/RR as detailed in `experiments.txt`.

`plots.py`: Simple plots script used to generate the effect of `k` and `de`.

**Update**: A refactored code version can be found on the `refactor` branch with faster evaluation. The results are slightly less (in third decimal) than this implementation.
